Overview
========

Taken from the [homework HTML file](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw05/hw05.html), here are the goals for this assignment:

-   Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.

-   Write some data to file and load it back into R.

-   Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.

-   Make a plotly visual.

-   Implement visualization design principles.
